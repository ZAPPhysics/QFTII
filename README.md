# QFTII
The code used and calculations performed for the video https://youtu.be/x3-Y6jL3yjQ

The following files are included in this repository:

- qftCalcs.pdf - Overview of the calculations performed both for the video and the code
- freeProp.py - Used to generate animations of the free, massive QFT and compare to the classical Schroedinger equation
- detectorAnim.py - Generates animation of the detector measuring the processes outlined in qftCalcs.pdf
- beamScan.py - Generates plot of the scattering rates of the processes outlined in qftCalcs.pdf as a function of beam energy (requires detectorAnim.py)
